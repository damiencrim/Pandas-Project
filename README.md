PyCity District Overview

**** Snapshot *****
In performing the analysis on the PyCity District Overview, it is easy to come to the conclusion that overall Charter Schools consistently outperform their District counterpart. However, when investigating further it is not so clear as to the reasoning behind this disparity and further research might be advantageous.

One major factor is the Per Student Budget. While the general thought may be that the more financial resources invested in a school and by default it's students should produce greater success, this data suggests that the amount spent per student is not the best indicator of success. As some of the lower performing schools may outspend their more successful counterparts, one major discrepancy appears to be in the school size. An indication that the fewer the number of students per school is a better matrix in predicting success.

However, across the board it appears that the greatest discrepancy can be found in the average Math Scores when comparing the two school types when comparing levels of success. While Reading Scores do trend higher in the Charter structure, the difference is negligible.

More concerning is that regardless of the type of school, students traversing from 9th Grade to 12th Grade didn't appear to elevate their respective scores, indicating a more flat trend than perhaps a desired increase.

While this study may reinforce the notion that students attending Charter Schools outperform those in a District setting, this data is limited in providing a direct cause for that assertion.
